# Badr AI Receptionist - System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the Badr AI Receptionist system architecture.

## System Components

The Badr AI Receptionist system consists of the following main components:

### 1. Hardware Components

- **Raspberry Pi 4B**: The main computing platform
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Noir**: For capturing images and video
- **USB PnP Audio Device**: For audio input and output
- **PIR Sensor**: Connected to GPIO 27 for motion detection

### 2. Software Components

- **Face Recognition System**: Identifies visitors and team members
- **Natural Language Processing Engine**: Understands intent and generates responses
- **Speech Processing System**: Handles voice interaction in English and Arabic
- **State Machine**: Manages conversation flow and system states
- **Integration Components**: Connects with email and notification systems

## System Workflow

1. **Idle State**: The system is in idle state, waiting for motion detection
2. **Motion Detection**: When motion is detected, the system activates the camera
3. **Face Recognition**: The system captures an image and attempts to identify the person
4. **Greeting**: If the person is recognized, the system greets them by name
5. **Conversation**: The system engages in conversation, understanding intent and generating responses
6. **Action**: Based on the conversation, the system takes appropriate action (scheduling appointment, providing information, etc.)
7. **Notification**: The system notifies team members as needed
8. **Conclusion**: The conversation ends, and the system returns to idle state

## Data Flow

## Security Considerations

- Face data is stored securely and is not accessible outside the system
- All communication is encrypted
- The system does not store conversation data beyond what is necessary for the current interaction
- Access to the system is restricted to authorized personnel
