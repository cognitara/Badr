## Who Am I?

Badr is a repurposed medical simulation robot that has traded its stethoscope for a front desk. Once a high-tech medical training tool, Badr has now embraced a new mission—acting as an AI-powered assistant that welcomes guests, manages schedules, and keeps things running smoothly at the Institute of Learning.

## What Can I Do Currently:

- **Bilingual Voice Interaction** – Supports both English and Arabic with improved microphone sensitivity
- **ChatGPT Integration** – Uses advanced AI for natural conversations with a touch of humor
- **Natural Language Processing** – Understands queries and generates useful responses
- **Appointment Scheduling** – Handles meeting requests so humans don't have to
- **Email Notifications** – Sends alerts for important events and system status updates
- **Modular Architecture** – Designed for easy customization and future expansions
- **Distributed Processing** – Supports distributed architecture across multiple Raspberry Pi devices

- **System Management** – Monitors system health and manages resources efficiently

## Future Upgrades:

- **Video Recording** – Records interactions for security and training purposes
- **Face Recognition & Registration** – Identifies team members and can register new visitors
- **Photo Capture** – Takes photos on request and can send them via email
- **Motion Detection** – Knows when someone arrives (no need to wave awkwardly)
- **Speak in Emirati** – Will be custom trained to speak Emirati accent and dialogue
- **Gesture Recognition** – Understand hand gestures for more intuitive interaction
- **Multi-language Support** – Add more languages beyond English and Arabic
- **Advanced Analytics** – Provide insights on visitor patterns and system usage
