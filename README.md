> "From diagnosing patients to greeting visitorsâ€”Badr's career change is proof that even robots can have a midlife crisis."


Badr is a repurposed medical simulation robot that has traded its stethoscope for a front desk. Once a high-tech medical training tool, Badr has now embraced a new missionâ€”acting as an AI-powered receptionist that welcomes guests, manages schedules, and keeps things running smoothly.

## Overview

This public repository contains high-level documentation and architectural insights into the Badr AI Receptionist project. While the inner workings are fascinating, the actual implementation code is not included in this public repository.

## Features

- **Motion Detection** â€“ Knows when someone arrives (no need to wave awkwardly).
- **Face Recognition** â€“ Identifies team members and frequent visitors (and remembers them better than most humans).
- **Voice Interaction** â€“ Supports both English and Arabic, including the Emirati dialect.
- **Natural Language Processing** â€“ Understands queries and generates useful responses (most of the time).
- **Appointment Scheduling** â€“ Handles meeting requests so humans don't have to.
- **Email Notifications** â€“ Sends alerts for important events and system status updates.
- **Modular Architecture** â€“ Designed for easy customization and future expansions.
- **Distributed Processing** â€“ Supports distributed architecture across multiple Raspberry Pi devices for enhanced performance.
- **Video Recording** â€“ Records interactions for security and training purposes.
- **System Management** â€“ Monitors system health and manages resources efficiently.

## Hardware Requirements

### Basic Configuration
- Raspberry Pi 4B
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Noir
- USB PnP Audio Device (microphone and speaker)
- PIR Sensor (for motion detection)

### Advanced Configuration (Distributed Architecture)
- Raspberry Pi 4B (Controller)
- Raspberry Pi 5 (Processor)
- 1TB SSD (connected to Pi 5)
- Ethernet connection between Pi 4 and Pi 5

## System Architecture

Badr AI Receptionist supports two deployment architectures:

### Single-Device Architecture
All components run on a single Raspberry Pi 4B, providing a compact and easy-to-deploy solution.

### Distributed Architecture
The system is distributed across two devices:
- **Pi 4 (Controller)**: Handles hardware interfaces, motion detection, camera capture, audio I/O
- **Pi 5 (Processor)**: Handles computationally intensive tasks like face recognition, NLP, speech processing

This distributed approach provides enhanced performance, better responsiveness, and increased reliability.
