> "From diagnosing patients to greeting visitorsâ€”Badrâ€™s career change is proof that even robots can have a midlife crisis."


Badr is a repurposed medical simulation robot that has traded its stethoscope for a front desk. Once a high-tech medical training tool, Badr has now embraced a new missionâ€”acting as an AI-powered receptionist that welcomes guests, manages schedules, and keeps things running smoothly.

## Overview

This public repository contains high-level documentation and architectural insights into the Badr AI Receptionist project. While the inner workings are fascinating, the actual implementation code is not included in this public repository.

Features

Motion Detection â€“ Knows when someone arrives (no need to wave awkwardly).

Face Recognition â€“ Identifies team members and frequent visitors (and remembers them better than most humans).

Voice Interaction â€“ Supports both English and Arabic, including the Emirati dialect.

Natural Language Processing â€“ Understands queries and generates useful responses (most of the time).

Appointment Scheduling â€“ Handles meeting requests so humans donâ€™t have to.

Email Notifications â€“ Sends alerts for important events and system status updates.

Modular Architecture â€“ Designed for easy customization and future expansions.


Minimum Hardware Requirements

Raspberry Pi 4B

Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Noir

USB PnP Audio Device (microphone and speaker)
